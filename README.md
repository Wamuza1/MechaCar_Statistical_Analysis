# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, we helped Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. We submited the following:

# Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG.
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG.

- The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.They have an  impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Moreover, other variables such as:  vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD  indicate a random amount of variance. 

- The p-Value is 5.35e-11, which is  smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. There is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which indcates The slope of the linear model considered to be not zero.

- This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

# Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip
